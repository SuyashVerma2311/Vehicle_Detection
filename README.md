# Vehicle Detection using CNN
_Project in Progress_   
The project is meant for a Vehicle Detection system
The was sourced in the form of around 17700 images of which 50% have vehicle in them and rest 50% don't have vehicle in them.

### Data:
 - The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/vehicle-detection-image-set
 - The data is in the form of 17k images in two separate folders
 - It was converted to csv (code for that can be found in this ![file](https://github.com/SuyashVerma2311/Vehicle_Detection/blob/main/Vehicle_detection/dataprocessing_model.ipynb)
 - Dataset Sample:
